# Juna-font

Juna is an Old-Style Serif font family, with some transitional characteristics.
The font is generated with the Adobe Font Developer Kit by using the provided script and setting files, after exporting a .pfa file from the source on Fontforge.

Originally based on the excellent Junicode font, the font has been substantially modified in many places (even excluding font-wide changes) and contains new glyphs and features.

**This is a work in progress**. The regular version is almost complete, but updating it *will be slow* on my end. Contributions are welcome!
